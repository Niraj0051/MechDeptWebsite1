              <td class="info">For thousands of years we have relied on burning fossil fuels to generate energy, but in today’s world
                using oil, gas and coal for our energy needs is becoming a problem. Climate change, energy security and
                depletion of fossil fuels are the three major problems faced in today’s life. These three are the major
                reasons that describe the need for renewable energy. In order to preserve our planet, our wallets and
                our energy sources we all need to be involved in switching to renewable energy sources.
                Our project is based on creating a mechanism to generate electricity from sea waves on the principle of
                floating bodies. The upward and the downward motion of the waves are trapped by using buoy as a floating
                body. The linear motion of the buoy is converted into rotary motion of the shaft by gear system and the
                rotating shaft in the power generation unit generates power. Our goal is to develop an efficient and low
                cost mechanism compared to other wave energy converters and other renewable energy devices. It is
                reliable, sustainable, environmentally friendly power extraction procedure from sea waves.</td>

                beyond human capacity may result in severe injuries to the workers. We will design an exoskeleton to
                lift a load (cuboidal box of dimension 50cm x 50 cm x 50cm), weighing 40kg from a table top, displace it
                by a distance of 10m and place it on another table with the help of an exoskeleton. The exoskeleton will
                make material handling and displacement easier in workshops where forklifts and cranes cannot be
                incorporated. We will be designing the upper and lower body to transmit the carried load to the ground
                resulting in less load on the operator. Linear electric actuators will be used to provide the necessary
                force which will be controlled by a micro controller (arduino) and supported by battery backup.

              <td class="info">Commercial kitchens waste large amounts of low-grade thermal energy, through the exhaust gases.
                Sustainability and energy conservation is the need of the hour. Waste heat recovery is a novel technique
                for sustainable and energy efficient solutions. However, waste heat recovery from low-grade heat sources
                has been a great challenge.
                The project aims at developing an efficient system, to recover the heat from exhaust gases in a
                commercial kitchen. In order to determine the quality and quantity of heat wasted, various commercial
                kitchens were surveyed. Plate-finned tube heat exchanger is designed, to recover the wasted heat. CFD
                analysis with different tube sizes and different flow rates are conducted to select the best
                alternative. The proposed system has been fabricated and experiments are being conducted to optimize the
                system for commercial use. This waste heat recovery system can be easily amalgamated with the existing
                kitchen exhaust system.

              <td class="info">The problem of inefficient wood burning Chula has become a global issue and in India mostly in rural
                areas, majority of women are suffering from respiratory diseases. After studying various literature we
                understood different stages of combustion and the phenomenon of heat transfer in chulas. We visited
                Adakhadak village for a pilot study and tried to understand the cooking practices, food habits, sources
                of firewood, health issues faced by women and design of Chula used by them. The design used by most
                villagers do not satisfy the requirements for efficient combustion .
                We designed a new Chula at DBIT on the basis of information collected from literature survey. We
                conducted water boiling test using the firewood obtained from Adakhadak village. We also conducted Orsat
                analysis first to check the composition of air but were unable to get accurate results. To enhance chula
                efficiency, we have designed grates to be placed in the chula. Tests are repeated with different grate
                designs.
                We plan to conduct CFD analysis to study temperature domain across Chula and air flow patterns to
                validate the results obtained with experimental results.

              <td class="info">A commercial washing machine isn’t practical in rural areas due to shortage of electricity and water.
                People residing in hostels also find it difficult to afford a commercial washing machine. The work
                presents a low load foot powered washing machine named “TUMBLer” which will tackle all these problems.
                It is a sustainable product, which can also operate at low loads without damaging the clothes. It
                converts a linear input provided by vertical pushing action of the feet to rotary motion of the drum.
                The main objective of the project is to fabricate a product which will eliminate the monotonous task of
                washing clothes by hand and saving the electricity costs associated with the conventional washing
                machines. The design of the tumbler is unique as it has simple mechanism and also relatively cheap and
                reliable. The major advantage of this product is that can be operated with ease by people of all age
                groups.
